ActivityReceiver is a API&CMS service(server-side) based on Windows/Linux.</br>
It works with client-side - [ActivityReceiver.iOS]().</br>

We retrieved users' Learning Records, and replay their operation for word reordering problems, calculating parameters for Machine Learning.</br>
It also allows administrators to manage contents of problems, exercises, grammars... on it.

## Development
You should use your own client using [ActivityReceiver.iOS](https://github.com/Neko3000/ActivityReceiver.iOS).</br>

Modify the connection strings to yours:
```
// appsettings.json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "ApplicationDbContextConnection": "Server=...",
  "ActivityReceiverDbContextConnection": "Server=..."
  },
```

And the DbContextInitializer would seed the database with some test data.
